# Analytics for Course Engagement (ACE) #

Analytics for Course Engagement (ACE) is a platform that provides students and staff with an enhanced real-time view of online engagement with learning systems. It builds on top of the Moodle Analytics API https://moodledev.io/docs/apis/subsystems/analytics/ and the new Reportbuilder API.

The University of Canterbury is currently running this on a heavily modified version of Moodle 3.9 that contains a backport of Moodle's reportbuilder API but are currently working on a version for Moodle 4.1.

It also currently requires the following trackers which we have been working on and trying to get into Moodle core.
https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-73184 (now in 4.1)
https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-73294 
https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-75170
https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-72974
https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-73104
https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-72831

We also use the a custom dashboard plugin (based on local_vxgdashboard) and a block that allows us to embed reportbuilder sources within the dashboard which is not currently available as an open-source plugin.
